CVS
===
Community Vulnerability Surveillance (CVS) is a RapidSMS application built on the work of Nic Pottier (rapidsms-xforms, rapidsms-httprouter) and the Millenium Villages Project (django-eav, healthmodels) to gather the following health information:
 - Case-by-case occurrences of malnutrition
 - Births
 - Under 5 year-old Deaths
 - Aggregate epidemiological data
 - Aggregate household health inicators (ITTNs, Handwashing facilities, etc.)

In addition to the message processing logic, CVS provides a set of reports and visualizations onto this data.  A running example of cvs can be viewed at cvs.rapidsms.org
