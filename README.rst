CVS
===
Community Vulnerability Surveillance (CVS) is a RapidSMS application built on the work of Nic Pottier (rapidsms-xforms, rapidsms-httprouter) and the Millenium Villages Project (django-eav, healthmodels) to gather the following health information:
 - Case-by-case occurrences of malnutrition
 - Births
 - Under 5 year-old Deaths
 - Aggregate epidemiological data
 - Aggregate household health inicators (ITTNs, Handwashing facilities, etc.)

In addition to the message processing logic, CVS provides a set of reports and visualizations onto this data.  A running example of cvs can be viewed at cvs.rapidsms.org

CVS Karamoja
============
With the roll-out to Karamoja, two additional reports were added to the CVS system:

 - Community-level aggregate reporting
 - Health Facility-leve stock and treatment reports

Additionally, feedback reports and alerts have been incorporated.
